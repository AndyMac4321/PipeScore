# PipeScore
## A modern bagpipe notation app

I started building this a while ago since I wasn't satisfied with other bagpipe notation apps that I found.

PipeScore's "killer feature" is reactive gracenotes - pipe embellishments that automatically update when you change the note that they are on. This means gracenotes can be added in sets (e.g. 'add a doubling to this note') rather than the user having to individually pick the correct one.

PipeScore is written in TypeScript and uses [uhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml) for rendering.

It is currently under development - see `current.txt` for a rough roadmap.
