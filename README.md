# PipeScore

## A bagpipe notation app

PipeScore is a free, easy-to-use, online bagpipe notation application. [Use it here!](https://pipescore.web.app)

PipeScore's unique feature is reactive gracenotes - pipe embellishments that automatically update when you change the note that they are on. This means gracenotes can be added in sets (e.g. 'add a doubling to this note') rather than the user having to individually pick the correct one.

PipeScore is powered by:

## Documentation

See `src/PipeScore/README.md` for documentation.

[This manual](http://bagpipe.ddg-hansa.com/Bagpipe_Reader.pdf) is a helpful guide to BWW files.

## Running locally

You will need:

- `python3` (along with the `svgwrite` package)
- `npm`
- `bun` (for faster tests)

Either install these manually, or run `nix-shell` to get the development environment.

To install node dependencies, run:

```bash
$ npm install            # install JS dependencies
```

To build JS files, icons and HTML pages, run:

```bash
$ npm run build     # build JS, static pages and icons
```

Run the following commands to run locally, ideally in separate terminals:

```bash
$ npm run dev       # run the development server
$ npm run watch     # rebuild JS on changes
$ npx tsc --watch   # typecheck
```

To run tests, use:

```bash
$ bun test
```

To build a production JS bundle run:

```bash
$ npm run build    # build minified bundle
```
