Thanks for considering contributing to PipeScore!

Before creating a PR, make sure your code passes:
* `tsc` -- type check
* `npm run lint` -- lint
* `npm run circles` -- check for circular dependencies

with no errors / warnings.

Apart from that, there's not much to say. Read the 'Project Structure' section of the README for a basic overview of the structure if you want.
