# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to PipeScore!

Before creating a PR, make sure your code passes:
* `tsc`
* `npm run lint`
* `npm run circles`

with no errors / warnings (except for the 'uhtml skipped' warning in circles).

Apart from that, there's not much to say. Read the 'Project Structure' section of the README for a basic overview of the structure if you want.
