Thanks for considering contributing to PipeScore!

Before creating a PR, make sure your code passes:
* `tsc` -- type check
* `npm run lint` -- lint
* `npm run circles` -- check for circular dependencies

with no errors / warnings.

Apart from that, there's not much to say. Read the README in `src/PipeScore` for a basic overview of the structure if you want.

If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue.
