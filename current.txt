A massive checklist


a todo list:
[x] fix slanted beams
[X] cap should be dependent on how many notes are in the group
[X] check / fix gaps between notes
[X] combine rests somehow into a single rest (if there are multiple next to each other)
[X] placing notes from a blank score (of different lengths)
[ ] fix random errors with adding note (it just throws an error sometimes)
[ ] HG -> HA gracenote on next note looks a bit crushed
[X] Any time rests are merged, some notes are deleted
[X] Make adding notes more frictionless
[ ] Make icons for note input
[ ] Dotted note can get crushed into next gracenote
[X] Width of drag boxes is wrong
[X] Automatically group notes to correct grouping
[X] Add notes before first note in bar and in empty bar
[X] Deleting multiple notes doesn't work
[X] todo in groupNotes function
[X] Add zoom
[X] previousNoteData should return correct x value
[X] Ties on notes on input (if inputted notes are split)
[X] Tied notes should move together
[X] When splitting really large notes right after a short note, the large note gets split into too many short notes
[ ] Merge long notes into long notes (semibreves into semibreves or minims, e.t.c.)
[X] Notes can't be added to the end of the bar
[X] Placing a minim then one before it causes stack overflow
[X] Placing a single quaver and then moving the mouse causes an error
[ ] Placing a note inside two tied notes should probably break the tie
