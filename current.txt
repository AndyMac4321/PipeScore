Notes

Perf:
* add/removeEventListener
* replaceChild

Bugs to fix:
[ ] Dotted note can get crushed into next gracenote
[ ] Deal with things (ties, second timings, selection, ...) going over stave break
[ ] Cut time
[ ] Notes with many beams can interfere with gracenotes (e.g. toarluath)
[ ] Preview note for current placement
[ ] Use correct previous note in all calls to widthOfAnacrusis
[ ] Better second timing usage - you should click to add, then be able to drag the sections around
[ ] Stricter bar lengths
[ ] Copy/paste
  [ ] have two types, 1 for reference and one for value?
  [ ] put over correct bars
[ ] Add options to override 'correct' functionality - e.g. automatic grouping, automatic gracenotes
[ ] Better time signature editing (it should only change as far as the time signature is the same)
[ ] Remove forced no-caching once images/js/e.t.c. is in a stable state
[ ] It is too easy to accidentally add notes
[ ] Possible triplets should have their own type since notes can't be added/destroyed/dotted/e.t.c.
[ ] Adding notes after triplets doesn't work

Bugs fixed:
[X] fix slanted beams
[X] cap should be dependent on how many notes are in the group
[X] check / fix gaps between notes
[X] combine rests somehow into a single rest (if there are multiple next to each other)
[X] placing notes from a blank score (of different lengths)
[X] fix random errors with adding note (it just throws an error sometimes)
[X] Any time rests are merged, some notes are deleted
[X] Make adding notes more frictionless
[X] Make icons for note input
[X] Width of drag boxes is wrong
[X] Automatically group notes to correct grouping
[X] Add notes before first note in bar and in empty bar
[X] Deleting multiple notes doesn't work
[X] todo in groupNotes function
[X] Add zoom
[X] previousNoteData should return correct x value
[X] Ties on notes on input (if inputted notes are split)
[X] Tied notes should move together
[X] When splitting really large notes right after a short note, the large note gets split into too many short notes
[X] Notes can't be added to the end of the bar
[X] Placing a minim then one before it causes stack overflow
[X] Placing a single quaver and then moving the mouse causes an error
[X] Delete second timings when their notes are deleted
[X] Delete noteXY when a note is deleted
[X] Have noteLeft, noteRight and noteY instead of noteXY
[X] Good default zoom
[X] Better zoom (instead of this weird 5 * 210 or whatever)
[X] Second Timings for bars
[X] ID for notes so that secondTiming can refer to that (also for bar, then there won't need to be different implementations!)
[X] Tied notes still have bugs - e.g. changes gap between notes
[X] a quaver then a crotchet in 6 8 produces 4 group notes
[X] Selected items should be in a line from start to end
[X] Selection should look nicer
[X] Making a selection then adding another note somewhere crashes it (the selection is no longer in the noteModels)
[X] Selecting a note then deleting its bar/stave leaves the selection box
[X] Text box dragging is broken
[X] Add transforms for texts
[X] Correct zoom on page load
[X] HG -> HA gracenote on next note looks a bit crushed
[X] Merge long notes into long notes (semibreves into semibreves or minims, e.t.c.)
  [X] Work out what the expected behaviour of groupNotes should be in regards to splitting notes into tied notes
[X] I think for ties - no automatic insertion / deletion - it's too subjective
[X] Tie-ing a crotchet to a semiquaver then placing a quaver in front breaks ties
[X] Crotchet triplets act as if there is a beam
[X] makeCorrectGroupings in Controller
