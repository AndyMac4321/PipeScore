Notes


Bugs to fix:
[ ] HG -> HA gracenote on next note looks a bit crushed
[ ] Dotted note can get crushed into next gracenote
[ ] Deal with things (ties, second timings, selection, ...) going over stave break
[ ] Merge long notes into long notes (semibreves into semibreves or minims, e.t.c.)
  [ ] Work out what the expected behaviour of groupNotes should be in regards to splitting notes into tied notes
[ ] Cut time
[ ] Notes with many beams can interfere with gracenotes (e.g. toarluath)
[ ] Preview note for current placement
[ ] Change selectedNotes to selectedItems? (use ID instead)
[ ] Clicking above notes probably shouldn't add the note

Bugs fixed:
[X] fix slanted beams
[X] cap should be dependent on how many notes are in the group
[X] check / fix gaps between notes
[X] combine rests somehow into a single rest (if there are multiple next to each other)
[X] placing notes from a blank score (of different lengths)
[X] fix random errors with adding note (it just throws an error sometimes)
[X] Any time rests are merged, some notes are deleted
[X] Make adding notes more frictionless
[X] Make icons for note input
[X] Width of drag boxes is wrong
[X] Automatically group notes to correct grouping
[X] Add notes before first note in bar and in empty bar
[X] Deleting multiple notes doesn't work
[X] todo in groupNotes function
[X] Add zoom
[X] previousNoteData should return correct x value
[X] Ties on notes on input (if inputted notes are split)
[X] Tied notes should move together
[X] When splitting really large notes right after a short note, the large note gets split into too many short notes
[X] Notes can't be added to the end of the bar
[X] Placing a minim then one before it causes stack overflow
[X] Placing a single quaver and then moving the mouse causes an error
[X] Delete second timings when their notes are deleted
[X] Delete noteXY when a note is deleted
[X] Have noteLeft, noteRight and noteY instead of noteXY
[X] Good default zoom
[X] Better zoom (instead of this weird 5 * 210 or whatever)
[X] Second Timings for bars
[X] ID for notes so that secondTiming can refer to that (also for bar, then there won't need to be different implementations!)
[X] Tied notes still have bugs - e.g. changes gap between notes
[X] a quaver then a crotchet in 6 8 produces 4 group notes
[X] Selected items should be in a line from start to end
[X] Selection should look nicer
[X] Making a selection then adding another note somewhere crashes it (the selection is no longer in the noteModels)
