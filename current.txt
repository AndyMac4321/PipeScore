A massive checklist

[x] fix slanted beams
[ ] cap should be dependent on how many notes are in the group
[X] check / fix gaps between notes
[X] combine rests somehow into a single rest (if there are multiple next to each other)
[X] placing notes from a blank score (of different lengths)
[ ] fix random errors with adding note (it just throws an error sometimes)
[ ] HG -> HA gracenote on next note looks a bit crushed
[X] Any time rests are merged, some notes are deleted
[X] Make adding notes more frictionless
[ ] Make icons for note input
[ ] Dotted note can get crushed into next gracenote
[X] Width of drag boxes is wrong
[X] Automatically group notes to correct grouping
