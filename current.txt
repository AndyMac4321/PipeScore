A massive checklist


next:

I just added rest functionality. Clean up needed:
* Make it more efficient ?
* Fix a thing with singleton -> it is centring the note on the x passed, but should be only after the x (I think, check this)



[x] fix slanted beams
[ ] cap should be dependent on how many notes are in the group
[X] check / fix gaps between notes
[ ] fix single gracenotes have a thick stem for some reason
[ ] calculate diff/e.t.c separately if there is a rest between notes
[ ] combine rests somehow into a single rest (if there are multiple next to each other)
[ ] placing notes from a blank score (of different lengths)
[ ] only do rest thing with rest under mouse (maybe
