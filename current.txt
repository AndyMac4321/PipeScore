A massive checklist


next:
definitely needs a clean up / refactor after adding note adding

[x] fix slanted beams
[ ] cap should be dependent on how many notes are in the group
[X] check / fix gaps between notes
[ ] calculate diff/e.t.c separately if there is a rest between notes
[X] combine rests somehow into a single rest (if there are multiple next to each other)
[X] placing notes from a blank score (of different lengths)
[ ] only do rest thing with rest under mouse (maybe)
[ ] fix random errors with adding note (it just throws an error sometimes)
[ ] HG -> HA gracenote on next note looks a bit crushed
[X] Any time rests are merged, some notes are deleted
[X] Make adding notes more frictionless
[ ] Make icons for note input
[ ] Width of drag boxes is wrong
[ ] Automatically group notes to correct grouping
