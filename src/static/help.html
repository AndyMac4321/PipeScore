        <iframe
          width="560"

        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Note: </strong>The video is slightly out of date, as PipeScore
          is still changing based on user feedback. However, it is definitely
          still helpful to watch it - just be aware that a couple of things look
          slightly different. The mechanics are all the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome! This page contains information about how to use PipeScore.
          You can search through this page using the
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Ctrl-F</span> keyboard shortcut in
          your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can't find what you're looking for, don't hesitate to contact
          me and ask!
        </p>
        <p>
          PipeScore is still being developed, so if you find any bugs (or you
          want me to add any features) just tell me and I'll do my best.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also hover over many elements in the main PipeScore interface.
          A relevant help message will be displayed in the bottom right hand
          corner of the screen.
        </p>

        <h2 id="before-begin">Before you begin</h2>
        <p>You can use PipeScore on any operating system</p>
        <p>
          PipeScore will not work on mobile, and it may look a bit squashed in
          small screens. If the interface is very cramped you could try zooming
          out in your browser, and then refreshing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must use a modern browser to use PipeScore. PipeScore should work
          on an up-to-date version of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Brave</li>
          <li>Chrome</li>
          <li>New Microsoft Edge</li>
          <li>Firefox</li>
        </ul>

        <p>PipeScore will definitely not work on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Explorer</li>
          <li>Old Microsoft Edge</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="accounts">Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You can use PipeScore without an account if you wish, to try it out.
          Your scores will not be saved if you do, since there isn't an account
          to save them to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accounts are completely free.
          <a href="/login">Create an account here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="creating-scores">Creating Scores</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have created your account, you will be redirected to the
          scores page. Here, you can create new scores, and modify the ones you
          already have. Press the
          <span class="button-name">New Score</span> button to create a new
          score.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will give you a quick-start menu, where you can specify a few
          things about your score. You can change these later.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will then enter the full interface. You can return to the scores
          page by pressing the Home button in the top left.
        </p>
        <p>
          To re-open a score in the interface, press the
          <span class="button-name">Edit</span> button.
        </p>

        <h2 id="saving">Saving</h2>
        <p>
          PipeScore automatically saves all your scores to the Cloud (so long as
          you have created your account), so you don't need to save it manually.
        </p>

        <h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>
        <p>
          You can print your score using the
          <span class="button-name">Print</span> button under the
          <span class="location">Document</span> tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          You <strong>must</strong> set <span class="option">Margin</span> to
          <span class="option">None</span> on the print preview page to print it
          properly. Unfortunately this cannot be automatic, due to a security
          feature in browsers that prevents the browser meddling with printer
          settings - so you will have to meddle with them instead!
        </p>

        <h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
        <p>The interface in PipeScore consists of three parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Top panel - the top panel contains sub-menus for different aspects
            of the score.
          </li>
          <li>
            Help pane - in the bottom left there is a help pane. Hover over
            anything in the top panel to see the documentation for it in this
            panel. You can disable it by ticking
            <span class="button-name">Disable Help</span> under the
            <span class="location">Settings</span> tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Score - the rest of the interface is the score. This can be zoomed
            in or out using the slider at the bottom of the General Commands.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="selection">Selection</h2>
        <p>
          You can select many items on the score by clicking them. This
          highlights them orange. You can select notes, text and bars this way
          (for bars, make sure you click a blank part of the bar that doesn't
          have any notes in it).
        </p>
        <p>
          For gracenotes, you can select single notes within the gracenotes by
          clicking on the note head. To select the whole gracenote, click the
          beam at the top of the gracenote that connects the notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to select more than one item, click on the first item and
          then press shift and click the last item. This is useful for selecting
          multiple notes and/or bars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can click on the first item and then press
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Shift Right</span> to expand the
          selection one item to the right, or
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Shift Left</span> to detract the
          selection to the left by one.
        </p>

        <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
        <p>
          You can add any note by clicking on the note length you want under the
          <span class="location">Note</span>
          tab, then clicking on the score where you want to place the note.
          PipeScore automatically places notes the correct space apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the keyboard shortcuts
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">1</span>,<span
            class="keyboard-shortcut"
            >2</span
          >,<span class="keyboard-shortcut">3</span>...<span
            class="keyboard-shortcut"
            >7</span
          >
          to select different note lengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          To stop inputting notes, press a blank area of the page, or press the
          Escape (<span class="keyboard-shortcut">esc</span>) key.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change a note's length, select it then click the note length you
          want under the <span class="location">Note</span> tab. To change a
          note's pitch, select the note, then drag the note up or down.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can delete a note by selecting it, then pressing the bin icon in
          the top panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can create a triplet by adding three notes, selecting all three,
          then pressing the triplet icon under the
          <span class="location">Note</span> tab. You can make a triplet turn
          back into normal notes by selecting any note in the triplet, then
          clicking the triplet icon.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can tie a note to the note before it by selecting the note, then
          pressing the tie icon in the top panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add a dot to any note by selecting the note then pressing the
          <span class="button-name">.</span> button in the top panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          F and C notes can have naturals. Click the natural marking in the
          <span class="location">Note</span> tab. This will only apply to notes
          that are either F or C.
        </p>

        <h2 id="copy-paste">Copying/Pasting</h2>
        <p>
          You can copy notes by selecting all the notes (or bars) you want to
          copy (see <a href="#selection">Selection</a> above), then pressing the
          copy button in the top panel (the icon looks like two pages next to
          each other). You can also use the
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Ctrl-C</span> shortcut if you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, select either the bar you want to paste them to, or a note that
          you want to paste them after, and press the paste button in the top
          panel (the icon looks like a clipboard). You can use the
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Ctrl-V</span> shortcut if you prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
          PipeScore will automatically keep the same bar breaks in the notes
          that you paste.
        </p>

        <h2 id="gracenotes">Gracenotes</h2>
        <h3 id="single-gracenotes">Single Gracenotes</h3>
        <p>
          You can add single a single gracenote by clicking the single gracenote
          under the <span class="location">Gracenote</span> tab, then clicking
          on the place you want to place the single.
        </p>
        <h3 id="embellishments">Embellishments</h3>
        <p>
          Embellishments in PipeScore are added in 'sets'. An example of a set
          is 'doubling', or 'toarluath'. PipeScore will then make sure that the
          embellishment placed on the score is the correct type based on the
          note that it's on. If you drag the note that the embellishment is on,
          it will update automatically.
        </p>
        <p>To add an embellishment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select the gracenote you want under the
            <span class="location">Gracenote</span> tab. Remember that PipeScore
            will choose the correct embellishment based on the note that you
            place it on, so for example, the C doubling button will place a B
            doubling if you add it to a B.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click either on the note you want to place it on, or just before the
            note you want to place it on. That will place the embellishment
          </li>
          <li>
            Press Escape (<span class="keyboard-shortcut">esc</span>) or click
            the background of the score to stop inputting gracenotes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can change which gracenote is on a note by selecting the note, and
          then clicking the gracenote type you want under the
          <span class="location">Gracenote</span> tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select individual notes in gracenotes by clicking on the
          gracenote head. You can then delete the individual note or drag it up
          or down. If you do this on a reactive gracenote, it will cease to be
          reactive, so it won't react to changes on the parent note.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can select an entire gracenote by clicking on the beams that
          connect the gracenote together.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bars">Bars</h2>
        <p>
          You can place a bar by selecting the bar before where you want to
          place it, then pressing
          <span class="button-name">Add bar before</span> under the
          <span class="location">Bar</span> tab. Alternatively, you can select
          the bar after where you want to place it and click
          <span class="button-name">Add bar after</span> under the
          <span class="location">Bar</span> tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can delete a bar by selecting the bar, then pressing the bin icon
          in the top panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change the repeats on a bar using the controls under the
          <span class="location">Bar</span> tab - you can change the start and
          end of the bar to either have a normal barline, a repeating start/end
          of part, or a non-repeating start/end of part.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change the size of a bar by clicking on the barlines and
          dragging left or right.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to move a bar to the previous stave (line), then you can
          use the <span class="button-name">Move to previous line</span> button.
          You can only do this for the first bar in the stave. To move multiple
          bars to the previous stave, move them one at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to move a bar to the next stave (line), then you can use
          the <span class="button-name">Move to next line</span> button. You can
          only do this for the last bar in the stave. To move multiple bars to
          the next stave, move them one at a time.
        </p>
        <h3 id="lead-ins">Lead ins</h3>
        <p>
          You can add lead-ins similar to adding bars, using the
          <span class="button-name">Add lead in before</span> and
          <span class="button-name">Add lead in after</span> buttons under the
          <span class="location">Lead In</span> tab. This will add a lead-in
          bar, which you can add notes to.
        </p>
        <p>
          All bar options work on lead-ins as well: you can select and delete
          lead-ins, change their time signatures, and everything else, using the
          options from the bar menu.
        </p>

        <h2 id="time-signatures">Time Signatures</h2>
        <p>
          You can edit the time signature of a bar by selecting the bar and then
          pressing <span class="button-name">Edit Time Signature</span> under
          the
          <span class="location">Bar</span>
          tab. This will bring up a edit menu that allows you to change what the
          time signature will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can bring up this edit menu of any time signature on the score by
          clicking the time signature.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the edit menu, choosing the
          <span class="button-name">Cut time</span> or
          <span class="button-name">Common time</span> option will set the time
          signature to use these timings (which are used in reels, for example).
        </p>
        <p>
          On the edit menu, under <span class="location">Advanced</span>, you
          can change the note grouping. By default PipeScore will group notes
          based on the bottom number of the time signature (for example, 8
          always uses 3-quaver length groups). However, in certain cases, such
          as irregular time signatures, this needs to be changed. In the
          <span class="location">Custom Grouping</span> box, you can enter the
          number of quavers that should be in each group. For example, if you
          want to have a group of 4 quavers then a group of 3, type
          <span class="option">4,3</span> in to the box. PipeScore will then
          group the notes in that bar (and any bars immediately afterwards that
          have the same time signature) with that grouping. PipeScore will also
          handle other note lengths (e.g. semiquavers) correctly based on the
          group lengths you gave.
        </p>

        <h2 id="staves">Staves</h2>
        <p>
          You can add a stave by selecting a bar on the stave above where you
          want to place it and clicking the
          <span class="button-name">+ After</span> button under the
          <span class="location">Stave</span> tab. Alternatively, you can select
          a bar on the stave below where you want to place it and click
          <span class="button-name">+ Before</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can delete a stave by selecting and deleting all the bars on the
          stave.
        </p>

        <h2 id="text-boxes">Text boxes</h2>
        <p>
          You can add a new text box by pressing the
          <span class="button-name">+</span> button under the
          <span class="location">Text</span> tab.
        </p>
        <p>You can edit any text box by double clicking it.</p>
        <p>
          You can delete a text box by selecting it and pressing the bin icon in
          the top panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can move a text box by clicking and dragging it. You can tell
          PipeScore to centre it by pressing the
          <span class="button-name">Centre text</span> button.
        </p>

        <h2 id="second-timings">Second Timings</h2>
        <p>
          You can place new second timings under the
          <span class="location">Bar</span> menu:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <span class="button-name">1st/2nd</span> button adds a second
            timing that includes both a first and second timing
          </li>
          <li>
            The <span class="button-name">2nd</span> button adds a second timing
            that includes only one timing
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can then drag the individual parts of the second timing around by
          clicking and dragging on the vertical lines of the second timing.
          PipeScore automatically snaps the lines to the closest note or bar on
          the score.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the text in the second timing, double click the text, and a
          dialogue should pop up.
        </p>

        <h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
        <p>
          You can add and remove pages under the
          <span class="location">Document</span> tab.
        </p>
        <h3 id="orientation">Orientation</h3>
        <p>
          You can change a score between portait and landscape by pressing the
          <span class="button-name">Portrait</span> and
          <span class="button-name">Landscape</span> buttons under the
          <span class="location">Document</span>
          tab.
        </p>

        <h2 id="playback">Playback</h2>
        <p>
          The playback controls are available under the
          <span class="location">Playback</span> menu. The first time you play a
          score, be aware that it may take slightly longer than normal to
          download the samples.
        </p>

        <h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard Input</h2>
        <p>
          These shortcuts are handy for inputting notes using only the keyboard:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Note length selection - use
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">1</span> for semibreve,
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">2</span> for minim,
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">3</span> for crotchet, e.t.c. Use
            the <span class="keyboard-shortcut">.</span> (fullstop) key to dot
            the note length. Press <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Esc</span> to
            stop inputting notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note input - use <span class="keyboard-shortcut">a</span> to add an
            A to the current selected bar (or after the current selected note),
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">b</span> for B, e.t.c. For High G
            and High A use <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Shift G</span> and
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Shift A</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigation - use the arrow keys (<span class="keyboard-shortcut"
              >left</span
            >/<span class="keyboard-shortcut">right</span>) to move notewise.
            Hold down shift while doing this to expand the selection. Use
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Tab</span> and
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Shift Tab</span> to move barwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Editing - use the
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">.</span> (fullstop) to dot the
            current note, <span class="keyboard-shortcut">t</span> to tie it to
            the previous note, and the up and down arrow keys to move the note
            up or down a semitone. Use the
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Delete</span> or
            <span class="keyboard-shortcut">Backspace</span> keys to delete the
            current selected note.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since changing the note length changes the length of the current
          selected note, the recommended way to input notes with the keyboard is
          to first add the note with the right pitch (e.g. by typing
          <span class="keyboard-shortcut">d</span>) then by correcting the note
          length (e.g. by typing <span class="keyboard-shortcut">4</span>).
        </p>

        <h2 id="sharing">Sharing your scores</h2>
        <p>
          To share your score with someone else, copy the url and send it to
          them. They can then open the score to view it (they will not be able
          to edit it).
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can download the score using the
          <span class="button-name">Download PipeScore file</span> button on the
          <span class="location">Document</span> tab. Other users may then
          import and edit the score by clicking
          <span class="button-name">Import PipeScore File</span> on the scores
          page, and choosing the file.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to save your score in a format that can be viewed by
          someone without a PipeScore account,
          <a href="#printing">print the score</a>, selecting
          <span class="button-name">PDF</span> as the printer device in the
          print options menu.
        </p>

        <h2 id="importbww">Importing from other Applications</h2>
        <p>
          You can import bagpipe scores from other applications. These must be
          in the Bagpipe Music Writer format (files ending in .bww or .bmw). To
          do this click <span class="button-name">Import BWW File</span> on the
          scores page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all BWW files can be imported - if you are having problems,
          <a href="/contact">send me the file</a>, and I'll see if I can sort it
          out for you.
